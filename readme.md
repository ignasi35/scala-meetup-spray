A very simple project to show some basic spray features during Scala Developers Barcelona Meetup.

The meetup will be organized around solving 5 problems (if time allows) using spray.io. The problems may look daunting but the idea is to see how simple spray makes specific tasks. Yes, that's cheating because I chose strenghts of spray.
